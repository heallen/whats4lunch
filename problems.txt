normalize_data.js
- incomplete units for ingredients
    - only has [cup(s), tsp(s), tbsp(s), lb(s), oz]
    - obvious misses: [liter(s), milliliter(s), gram(s)]
    - other obvious misses: tsp to tbsp conversions, tbsp to cup, etc.
    - difficult to quantify: [a pinch, a bit, sprig(s), large]
- suboptimal ingredient matching
    - very non-standard ingredients list in recipes.json
    - nutrition.json vs recipes.json (different formatting)
    - ex: SPICES,THYME
